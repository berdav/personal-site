			<h1>CVE-2020-2703</h1>
			<h2>20 February 2020</h2>
			<p>
			Hi!<br/>
			<br/>
			Recently I discovered an issue in the VirtualBox VM hypervisor.
			This famous piece of software can be extended by using the so-called
			VirtualBox extension packs.  This packs enable the platform
			to have enhanced features and one of them is the PCIe pass-through.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			I'm an avid user of the PCIe pass-through in <code>KVM</code> and I wanted
			to try this kind of feature also in the VirtualBox hypervisor.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			This feature can be activated by using the <code>--pci-attach</code> flag and
			specifying a PCI bus to attach to the virtual machine.
			<br/>
			Obviously, this feature must be regulated by some kind of
			group or super-user only access, but that is not the case.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			In this case this can lead to two problematics:
			<ul>
				<li>Any unprivileged user on the machine can pass
				a device of the machine causing (at least) a denial
				of service.</li>
				<li>Any unprivileged user on the machine can steal
				data from devices excluding them from the host.</li>
			</ul>
			First, I have tried to pass a critical device in the virtual machine,
			this nuked my running system, stealing a device from the
			host.  Then, I've tried to pass a disk which was a part of
			a software <code>RAID-1</code> into the virtual machine, placing the disks
			on different PCI buses.  This experiment can lead to
			the leak of <code>/etc/shadow</code> files or analogous leaks.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			In the end I've sent a PoC to the oracle security team,
			which replied immediately to this issue, fixing the
			hypervisor.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			Bye,<br/>
