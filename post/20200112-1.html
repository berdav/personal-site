			<h1>Starting a new "blog"</h1>
			<h2>12 January 2020</h2>
			<p>
			Hi!<br/>
			<br/>
			Welcome to my new "blog"!  As you can see
			this is not the most eye appealing or parallax
			equipped blog[1]. But if you're like me (and so you are
			going to appreciate the content on this blog), you
			will concentrate on the concepts and portability
			of this page.<br/>
			<br/>
			That is, this is a site that will maintain a
			list of guide and things that maybe will be done
			not using graphical browser or, maybe, you don't
			give anything about the appealing of this site
			if you're searching for the command to query the
			<code>LDAP</code> server.<br/>
			<br/>
			I hope that you'll enjoy the contents...when
			there will be some. :)<br/>
			<br/>
			Bye,<br/>
			D.<br/>
