			<h1>Flashing ice40hx8k-evb Open Source FPGA with an ft2232h</h1>
			<h2>04 June 2020</h2>
			<p>
			Hi!<br/>
			<br/>
			Recently I had to flash a test program in my ice40hx8k-evb[1]
			board.<br/>
			<br/>
			This PGA has the killer feature of being completely programmable
			without proprietary tools[2] and to be a fully open source
			design, unlike almost all competitors'
			products.  Futhermore this FPGA is sold to the customer market at low
			price making it a perfect target for the maker community.
			<br/>
			One of the downsides of this FPGA is the lack of high speed clocks[3]
			and the limited number of available LUTs (1K or 8K).
			<br/>
			<h2>Structure of the ice40 FPGA Evaluation board</h2>
			This board is composed of the base FPGA chip (cn256) and a reference
			quartz oscillator at 100MHz.  <br/>
			<br/>
			The cn256 model of the FPGA has a configurable PLL onboard, this
			device can multiply the frequency of our input clock to achieve higher
			frequencies, ice40hx8k's PLL can lock to frequency 64 times higher than
			the input frequency (but be aware that the FPGA internal circuitery
			cannot handle such high frequencies!).  <br/>
			<br/>
			This will enable us to use high speed clocks starting with a slower
			(and precise) clock source.
			<br/>
			
			<h2>Programming the FPGA</h2>
			The interactions with the FPGA are not handled by any operating system.
			You'll need a direct interaction with the storage medium of the FPGA
			to write the bitstream.  <br/>
			<br/>
			We will need some hardware and software for this task,
			my current lab setup is composed of: <br/>
			Hardware:
			<ul>
			<li>1 x ICE40HX8K-EVB FPGA</li>
			<li>1 x SPI interface. I have a ft2232h breakout board, it can be an iceduino, raspberry pi or a buspirate.
			<li>1 x USB power supply, I have a power supply which provides 2400mA.</li>
			<li>1 x Homemade cable to power up the FPGA using an USB power supply.</li>
			<li>6 x dupont cable female to female (you may need
			some other gender combinations depending on your SPI
			interface).  Preferably <= 10cm of length.</li>
			</ul>
			<br/>
			Software:
			<ul>
			<li>Icestorm[2]: to program the FPGA.</li>
			<li>Yosys[4]: to syntetize the verilog program.</li>
			<li>nextpnr[5]: to perform the place and route.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>ft2232h</h3>
			The ft2232h is a USB to serial protocol interface, is capable of
			interface USB bus to SPI, JTAG, UART, I2C and bit-banging other
			protocols. It is fully compatible with OpenOCD[6] and Flashrom[7] thus
			enabling the flashing of the bitstream on the on-board E²PROM.
			<br/>
			Drivers for this kind of chips are shipped in every modern pre-compiled
			kernel for common distributions (Arch Linux, Debian, Ubuntu).

			<h3>icestorm</h3>
			Icestorm is an open source (GPL) toolchain for ice40 FPGAs.  It can be
			used to program and read flash chips.  It is fully compatible with
			ft2232h (Clifford Wolf developed the tool for this platform).
			To compile icestorm you should follow this steps:
			<pre> <code>
$ git clone https://github.com/cliffordwolf/icestorm
$ cd icestorm
$ make
# make install
			</code> </pre>
			Looking in the code of icestorm we can see that the pinout for bit-banging the
			flash is a little different from the datasheet of the ft2232h:
			<br/>
			From <a href="https://github.com/cliffordwolf/icestorm/blob/master/iceprog/mpsse.c">
			https://github.com/cliffordwolf/icestorm/blob/master/iceprog/mpsse.c</a>
			<pre> <code>
/* FTDI bank pinout typically used for iCE dev boards
 * BUS IO | Signal | Control
 * -------+--------+--------------
 * xDBUS0 |    SCK | MPSSE
 * xDBUS1 |   MOSI | MPSSE
 * xDBUS2 |   MISO | MPSSE
 * xDBUS3 |     nc |
 * xDBUS4 |     CS | GPIO
 * xDBUS5 |     nc |
 * xDBUS6 |  CDONE | GPIO
 * xDBUS7 | CRESET | GPIO
 */
			</code> </pre>
			Using this pinout we can connect the FPGA pins to our FT2232H chip.
			Keep in mind that GND should be connected and 3.3V pin _must_ be left
			floating.
			<br/>
			Looking from the component side you should see this connector:
<pre> <code>
ICE40
  │
  │ PCB
  │     ┌──┐
  │ SSB │··│ SCK
  │ SDO │··│ SDI
  │CRST │··  CDONE
  │ TXD │··│ RXD
  │ GND │··│ 3.3V
  │     └──┘
  │ Power
  │  Jack
  └─────────────────
</code></pre></br>
			Connect to the correct pins of your FT2232H board, and then
			you should have a result similar to this one:
			<img src="../data/setup_ft2232h_ice40hx8k.png"></img><br/>
			In this image you can see:
			<ul>
				<li>My ice40hx8k (the red board)</li>
				<li>My homemade power cable, it simply connects power lines of
				an USB cable to a power jack connector.</li>
				<li>My ft2232h breakout board (the green one)</li>
			</ul>

			Pressing the reset button present on the FPGA PCB we can dump or
			reprogram the flash.  <br/>
			<br/>
			Power up the FPGA and the programmer, press and keep the reset button,
			launch <code># iceprog -t</code> to identify the flash and you should see some binary
			garbage different from 0xff and 0x00.<br/>
			<br/>
			If you experience some difficulties try to slow down the clock using
			<code># iceprog -t -s</code> and append the <code>-s</code> switch to every
			<code>iceprog</code> command.<br/>
			<br/>
			If this, again, fails, try to use shorter wires, the connections shall
			be &lt; ~15cm.
			<h3>Our first flash interaction</h3>
			After checking the connection between the FPGA and the programmer you
			can try to retrive the running bitstream, using
			<code># iceprog -r /tmp/flash-content.bin</code>, after some time you will receive
			a binary file.  As a rule of thumb you can try to read some strings
			present in the bitstream using <code>strings</code>:<br/>
			<br/>

		<pre><code>
$ strings /tmp/flash-content.bin
Lattice
iCEcube2 2015.04.27409
Part: iCE40HX8K-CT256
Date: Jun 29 2017 09:22:59
Bx08
</code> </pre>
			This will confirm that our read is good.  As a more accurate check you
			can try to re-read some times the flash and check if the read lead to
			the same file.<br/>
			<br/>
		<pre><code>
$ sha512sum /vagrant/read*
dd2f1c3f0a7f6868da8cad82860a40738...
026d7a6114558efda981c50308737bb71...
dd2f1c3f0a7f6868da8cad82860a40738...
		</code></pre><br/>

			As you can see the first read and the third read lead us to the same
			file, in the second read we had some reading problems.

			<h3>Blinking leds</h3>
			To syntetize and compile our first program we need the syntesizer
			program and the place and route tool.  In the open source toolchain
			this tools are called respectively: <code>yosys</code> and
			<code>next-pnr</code>.
			
			This tools are the basis for the compilation of FPGA bitstreams.
			Our first project will be the blinking leds demo available at the end of this
			page[8] <br/>
			<br/>
			With this test you can see the led working and check if your
			programming setup is done well.  <br/>
			<br/>
			As you can see, the program is in VHDL, not in Verilog, to transpile
			the unsupported language in Verilog a tool called vhd2vl[9] is employied.  <br/>
			<br/>
			As described in the previous section, you can flash the generated bitstream
			in your FPGA using <code># iceprog ./led.bin</code><br/>
			<br/>
			Have fun with your open source FPGA! :)<br/>
			If you have some question send me an e-mail or a Telegram message, you
			can find the addresses in the home page!

			Bye,<br/>
