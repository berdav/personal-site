			<h1>Simulating Raspberry PI GPIO interaction with QEMU</h1>
			<h2>4 December 2020</h2>
			<p>
			Hi!<br/>
			<br/>
			QEMU is an awesome software.
			When I do operating system
			development-related things, I always
			try them in QEMU.  That's the case of simulating
			GPIOs.<br/>
			<br/>
			From time to time I've to do some
			operating-system lessons.  Some of
			these lessons need to interact with devices and
			I want to explain how to interact with GPIOs.<br/>
			<br/>
			To do so I would need to tell to every student
			to buy a Raspberry Pi or another devboard, which
			is unbearable.  If a student broke his Raspberry
			or lose it or whatever, he would need to buy
			another one.<br/>
			<br/>
			But every student always have a computer, which
			is usually running a Linux distribution. :)<br/>
			<br/>
			For this task, I've developed a simulator, than
			you can download at [1].  With this you can
			simulate GPIOs on a virtual raspberry Pi.<br/>
			<br/>
			<h2>Searching for a simulation</h2>
			<p>There are some related works that can help
			to interact with gpios from a virtual machine:
			virtualgpios, gpios-mockup, etc etc.  All of
			these cannot emulate "real"
			raspberry gpios. I would need to recompile a
			kernel module or give to the users a strange
			command which will overfit the setup.</p>
			<p>Therefore the only way to do so is from QEMU itself.</p>
			<p>
			The GPIOs are MMIO (Memory Mapped I/O):
			a write issued to a specific memory location,
			will issue a command on the GPIO controller.
			Therefore is extremely easy to modify, we just
			need to write on the guest memory. :)
			</p>
			<img width="95%" src="../data/bcm2835-gpios.png"></img>
			<p>In this image you can see the mapping of GPIOs
			controls and their memory addresses.  A more
			detailed documentation is presented in the bcm2835
			datasheet[2].
			</p>

			<h2>Searching for a writer</h2>
			<p>
			To interact with MMIO we need to write in the guest memory.
			</p>
			<p>
			Qemu offers a debug protocol, documented in [3], <b>qtest</b>.
			This is a line-based protocol which can be
			attached to an Unix socket.  Interacting with this UNIX
			socket (for instance, with <code>socat</code>) we can write
			commands such as:
			</p>

			<p>
<br/>
<pre><code><span style="color:red">readl 0x10000</span>
<span style="color:blue">OK 0x0000000000</span>
<span style="color:red">writel 0x10000 0x10</span>
<span style="color:blue">OK</span>
</code></pre>
<br/>

			Respectively to read and write a long word.
			(In red you see my requests, in blue the responses).
			</p>

			<p>
			Pretty easy, no?  Well...sort of...if you write a
			wrong command on the socket, the qemu hypervisor will
			explode, and with it your swearing.
			</p>
			<p>
			Also, we have a technical problem, if we try to
			write on the location of the GPIO MMIO specified
			in the datasheet (0x7e20xxxx), nothing will happen...
			</p>

			<h2>Search a guest memory location</h2>
			Fortunately, every buffer allocated with
			<code>memory_map_*</code> functions [4] of
			Qemu APIs is labeled.  You can find it using a command
			in the qemu monitor:<br/><br/>
			<pre><code>(qemu) info mtree
...
    000000003f200000-000000003f200fff (prio 0, i/o): bcm2835_gpio
</code></pre><br/>

			<p>
			We can clearly see that the memory location
			<code>0x3f200000</code> is our GPIO MMIO.
			Using this as specified in the datasheet will get us to our goal of
			writing and reading GPIOs! :)</p>
			<p>
			That's how the <code>get $N</code> and <code>set $N $V</code> of the
			application published at [1] works.
			</p>
			<p>
			This procedure is also applicable at vanilla qemu.
			</p>

			You can try it launching virtual-gpio and then exporting gpio 4 in the
			virtual machine with the following commands:
			<ol>
			<li>
				Setup the Virtual Raspberry pi using <code>$ ./setup.sh</code>
			</li>

			<li>Launch the virtual-gpio application
<br/><br/>
<pre><code>
$ ./virtual-gpio
[ ] Virtual GPIO manager
[ ] Listening for connections
(gpio)> 
</code></pre><br/></li>

			<li>Execute qemu (remember to keep
			<code>virtual-gpio</code> open!!!) using
			<code>$ ./run.sh</code></li>

			<li>Wait for the guest to boot, login and then
			export a GPIO from Linux:
			<br/><br/>
			<pre><code>
# echo 4 >/sys/class/gpio/export
# echo in >/sys/class/gpio/gpio4/direction
# cat /sys/class/gpio/gpio4/value
0
</code></pre>
<br/>

			<li>Modify the value of the GPIO from the
			<code>virtual-gpio</code> application:
<br/>
<br/>
<pre><code>(gpio)> set 4 1
</code></pre>
<br/>

			<li>Read the result in the guest system
<br/>
<br/>
<pre><code># cat /sys/class/gpio/gpio4/value
1
</code></pre>
<br/>
			</li>
			</ol>

			<h2>The desperate quest for an interrupt</h2>

			<p>
			If you experiment a little more with GPIOs you'll see
			that interrupt-based interaction (with the file
			<code>/sys/class/gpio/$gpioN/edge</code>)
			is not working
			</p>

			<p>That's because qemu support for bcm2583 GPIOs is not
			present. You can find a patched version of the hypervisor
			at [5], using this one you'll get interrupt delivered to
			your guest OS application!
			</p>

			<p>
			In details, this patch connect the
			<code>bcm2583_gpio.c</code> device, which controls
			Raspberry Pi MMIO GPIOs, to the
			<code>bcm2583_ic.c</code> interrupt controller.

			With this bus we can ask to the Interrupt Controller
			to fire a specific GPU interrupt
			delivering interrupts using the
			<code>qemu_set_irq</code> function.

			These interrupts are grouped in three, as stated by the
			kernel code [6].  The first GPU interrupt we need to fire
			is the interrupt 49.  Using this the first bank of GPIOs
			(0-27) will be signalled.  Then, the guest will ask for
			which GPIO raised the interrupt, which is specified in
			the EDS register.
			</p>

			<p>
			Also, the kernel need to set-up specific registers to
			instruct the BCM2583 of which interrupt it wants.
			These registers are loaded and managed in the same file
			which handles GPIOs (bcm2583_gpios.c).
			</p>

			<p>
			The behaviour could be schematized as follows:

			</p>

			So, that's all for now, have fun with your virtual
			Raspberry PI and let me know what do you think of it!
			<br/>
			<br/>
			Bye,<br/>
