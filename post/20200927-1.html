			<h1>Reading emails: mutt + mbsync + mairix + imapfilter</h1>
			<h2>27 September 2020</h2>
			<p>
			Hi!<br/>
			During the last years (when I've started
			working), I've started to receive e-mails from
			different sources: students, co-workers,
			social-networks, security bulletins, spam,
			online required registrations (sigh...).<br/>
			<br/>
			I hate reading promotional emails, because they
			are full of crappy html and requires time to be
			filtered.<br/>
			<br/>
			Therefore I reviewed my e-mail Raspberry OpenBSD
			setup (but can be ported to every POSIX
			operating system, such as GNU/Linux) which, at the
			moment is composed of:<br/>
			<br/>
			<ul>
				<li><code>mutt</code> --
					I love mutt[1].  It is fast, simple to use
					and super customizable.  If you've read
					the first page I hate html email.
					That's for mutt.
				</li>
				<li><code>mbsync</code> --
					I want to have my email
					backup in a local (encrypted)
					storage.  I don't want to lose
					them because an online service
					stop working and I've not done
					the opt-out. ;)<br/>
					<br/>
					mbsync[2] just do this task.  It
					download the emails to a
					configurable directory.
					<br/>
					Also, having the e-mails in a local
					storage makes mutt ultra-fast.<br/>
					<br/>
					The only downside is that
					I need to sync manually the mail
					every N minutes.  That makes the
					synchronization process a less
					real-time (but its for
					email...it is ok to wait 5
					minutes to get a notification).
					If I'm waiting for an email
					which I know was sent, I can
					synchronize them manually.
				<li><code>msmtp</code> --
					SMTP must be simple (as the name
					of the protocol states).  msmtp[3]
					is a simple tool wrote with UNIX
					philosophy.  You simply put the
					mail in it and it will do its
					SMTP-related things.
					Straightforward configuration
					and easily paired with mutt.
				<li><code>mairix</code> --
					While I do not have a lot of
					emails (~5k per account with 4
					accounts), I do not want to lose
					time searching with clumsly IMAP
					search.  Therefore I use
					mairix[4]
					with mutt integration to search
					them.
					<br/>
					Before mairix, I've used mu for
					this task.  The problem is that
					mu uses redis, which is really
					slow on my OpenBSD configuration
					on the Raspberry pi (Probably,
					the encrypted disk is
					incompatible with the giant
					database file created by redis).
					<br/>
				<li><code>imapfilter</code> --
					Another thing I want to do is
					automatically move secondary
					emails from the INBOX to a
					specific directory.  I don't
					want to do it only locally but
					also on server side (maybe I
					can't access my system to read
					emails, but I can do it using
					the awkward web-interface).
					<br/>
					To do so I use imapfilter [5], which
					is a really simple program to
					write server side filters and
					take actions.  It is
					configurable in LUA.
				<li><code>cron</code> -- To automatize
					synchronization I use a simple
					crontab.  A script to
					synchronize emails gets executed
					every 5 minutes.
			</ul>

			<br/>
			That's for my setup, let's see in detail the configurations:

			<h3>mutt</h3>
			<!-- immagine mutt -->
			At the link[6], you can find my .muttrc.  As you
			can see I can select the inbox and the email to
			use using Function keys (F1 for the first
			account, etc, etc).  Every account file in .mutt
			has the following format[7].  In these file I've
			specified the maildir configured in
			.mbsyncrc.<br/>
			<br/>
			To create mails I use <code>vim</code>, started
			automatically in insert mode and with a colored
			column at 70 chars.<br/>
			<br/>
			Another thing configured in the file is the
			auto-dump of html emails.  In extreme cases you
			can't see the URL in them and you need to
			download the email and open it in the browser
			(double check it to see if it contains js or
			auto-loading images!!!), or just
			<code>cat</code> it to a terminal and copy and
			paste the URL.<br/>
			<br/>
			I don't do it too much, just 1/2 times per year,
			for services which don't have a correct
			pure-text mail handling (somebody said
			conferences?).<br/>
			<br/>

			<h3>mbsync</h3>
			.mbsyncrc is composed of fragments like the ones
			you can see in [8], one per account.  As you can
			see I've configured gpg and placed (encrypted)
			passwords in an encrypted directory.  Using gpg
			you can also specify the passphrase in a file
			passed on the command line to automatize the
			workflow.<br/>
			<br/>
			Using mbsync -a you will synchronize local
			directories with remote IMAP server.<br/>
			<br/>
			When I was synchronizing gmail for the first
			time I've got banned with a strange error
			"Lockdown in sector 4".  That's because Gmail
			does not support such an use-case ( downloading
			10k emails in a day ;) ) therefore do it when
			you're basically free from emails or synchronize
			just a part of mails per day.<br/>
			<br/>

			<h3>msmtp</h3>
			To send emails, the configuration is really
			similar to the one of mbsync.  In my .msmtprc[9]
			you can see that I've configured the options to
			manage the encrypted passwords and basic
			informations such as the remote SMTPS server,
			tls support and the logfile.<br/>
			<br/>
			When using multiple accounts you only need to
			replicate the part which configures Gmail.<br/>
			<br/>

			<h3>mairix</h3>
			Mairix is a tool which is almost drop in, you
			only need to instruct it where you have your
			maildirs and which directories it must search
			[10].<br/>
			<br/>
			Choose a name for the resultant maildir and set
			it in .muttrc.
			The following lines from .muttrc configure
			mairix search:<br/>
			<br/>
<pre><code>macro generic ,f "<shell-escape>mairix " "search with mairix"
macro generic ,,f "<change-folder><kill-line>=.Search<enter>" "load the search results mailbox"
</code></pre><br/>
			<br/>
			Pressing <code>,f</code> you will search for emails (e.g.
			pressing <code>,f thesis</code> you can search
			for the emails containing "thesis"), when the
			search is done you can display it using
			<code>,,f</code>.<br/>
			<br/>
			When you want to index new emails (such as every
			time you receive an email), you need to use:
			<code>mairix -v -F</code> to index the
			configured mailboxes.

			<h3>imapfilter</h3>
			Imapfilter is one of the most powerful tools in
			this list.  It is configurable by using lua
			scripts. You can find mine here[11].<br/>
			<br/>
			The configuration script
			(~/.imapfilter/config.lua) gets executed every
			time you issue <code>imapfilter</code>.  In
			details the filter posted does:
			<br/>
			<ol>
				<li>Read the password file and login to
					Gmail;</li>
				<li>Get the messages of the last 30
					days;</li>
				<li>Filter them by searching
					<code>social@network.com</code>
					in the "From" header;</li>
				<li>Put the matched messages in a
					specific directory (which
					probably I will never read ;)
					).</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>cron</h3>
			As I said previously, the mail synchronization
			is a manual process, to automatize it I have a
			simple script [12] that does, in order:

			<ol>
				<li>Synchronize emails using mbsync</li>
				<li>Filter them server side using imapfilter</li>
				<li>Index the emails using mailrix</li>
			</ol>
			The system executes this script every 5
			minutes during the day using cron:<br/>
			<br/>
<pre><code>$ crontab -l
*/5 * * * * /home/user/mbsync.sh</code></pre><br/>
			<br/>
			<br/>
			That's it!  If you have some suggestions or problems with a similar
			setup do not hesitate to contact me...via email ;) <br/>
			<br/>
			You can find my address (a little obfuscated) in the home page.  <br/>

			Bye, <br/>
