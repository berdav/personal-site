			<h1>Inject virtual machines in the clouds</h1>
			<h2>31 March 2020</h2>
			<p>
			<b>TL;DR:</b>[5]<br/>
			<br/>
			Hi!<br/>
			Recently we[1] played saarctf[2].  It was really really funny
			to play.
			This competition was an attack/defence CTF, you can find a
			link[3] to the liveoverflow video that describe how this
			kind of competitions works.<br/>
			<br/>
			As you can see from the site of the CTF, it includes a router
			per team in the network layout.  Based on Linux.
			But...when we decided our infrastructure the chosen operating
			system for the routing was OpenBSD.  How unfortunate!<br/>
			<br/>
			That is not a problem, you may think, you replace the provided
			router with your OpenBSD machine and you're well to go.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			Well, yes...and no.<br/>
			<br/>
			This was the first attack/defence CTF we
			played from home thanks to the ncovid-2019. :)
			As many of us doesn't have powerful x86_64 machines and/or
			optical-fiber based network connection we decided to use
			a cloud provider to host our infrastructure[4].<br/>
			<br/>
			And now comes the problem: many cloud providers do not
			support OpenBSD.<br/>
			<br/>
			<h3>VM injector</h3>
			To run an unsupported operating system on the cloud I've
			created a script that push the operating system raw image
			and burn it into the virtual disk[5].<br/>
			<br/>
			If you are still reading I suppose that you do not want
			a copy and paste of the readme of the project but the gory details
			in their entire glory. ;)<br/>
			<br/>
			When the image get pushed we cannot just burn it to the
			running disk.  We need, at least, to move it to a disk that will
			not be touched by the burning process and unmount the target disk.
			Unfortunately, the root partition is on the disk we want to nuke. :)<br/>
			<br/>
			This bring us to the next component of the script, <code>pivot_root</code>.
			This systemcall will change the running root of the system, giving us
			the opportunity to mount the system over a ramdisk and wipe the main
			disk.  As we will not have any program in the new root we first copy
			busybox and the target image to a new ramdisk, and then we <code>pivot_root</code> in.<br/>
			<br/>
			After that step we can <code>dd</code> the new disk over the pre-installed
			main disk and reboot.  Then the new system will (hopefully) show up.<br/>
			<br/>
			<h3>OpenBSD autoinstall installXX.fs</h3>
			There is only another step to complete our system: OpenBSD can be
			autoinstalled using a file called <code>/install.conf</code>.  To do so you
			need to recompile the OpenBSD install image and place the file in the root of
			your custom <code>install.fs</code><br/>
			<br/>
			If you don't have an OpenBSD system the easiest way to
			do that is create a virtual machine running it.  The installation process
			is pretty straightforward, but we have a <b>vagrant</b> VirtualBox virtual machine
			available in the vagrant repository[6].
			<br/>
			You can init that machine using
			<pre> <code>$ mkdir openbsd_autoinstaller
$ cd openbsd_autoinstaller
$ cat - >Vagrantfile <<_END_
# -*- mode: ruby -*-
# vi: set ft=ruby :

Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.box = "berdav/openbsd6.6"
  config.ssh.shell = "/bin/ksh"
  config.ssh.sudo_command = "/bin/doas %s"

  config.vm.box_check_update = true

  config.vm.synced_folder ".", "/vagrant",disabled: true

  config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
    # Customize the amount of memory on the VM:
    vb.memory = "4096"
  end
end
_END_
$ vagrant up
$ vagrant ssh </code> </pre>
			Now that you've an installation of OpenBSD up and running
			you can configure your custom installfs.
			<br/>
			In a following post I'll show how to create a custom install fs with a script.
			<br/>
			<br/>

			Have fun and stay home!<br/>
