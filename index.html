		<h1>D. - Personal site</h1>
		<p>Hello there, this is my personal and work site/blog. You can find
		here a list of the interesting things that I saw in the last time.</p>

		<p>Currently, I am a PhD student at university of Bologna and
		my research is focused on network security.  I am a member of
		<a href="https://ulisse.unibo.it/">Ulisse</a> research team and, sometimes, I play CTFs.  I am also a proud member of
		the <a href="http://admstaff.students.cs.unibo.it">ADMStaff</a> team and the <a href="http://virtualsquare.org">VirtualSquare</a> group.
		</p>

		<p>In a previous work-life I was a firmware engineer, so I tend
		to integrate embedded systems in every work I do.  Especially
		if they are powerful enough to run OpenBSD and IPv6.</p>

		<p>To reach me you can use the following methods:
			<ul>
				<li><b>e-mail</b>: my address is <code>${given_name}.${family_name}6@unibo.it</code> or
				<code>${given_name}.${family_name}@studio.unibo.it</code>.
				You can easily check the correct address searching me on the university site.
				Please, avoid <code>html</code> mail as much as you can[1] and do not expect a
				low latency reply.</li>
				<li><b>Telegram</b>: My nickname is composed by the first three letters of my family
				name and the first three letters of my given name (with capital letters).  Usually I reply within a short
				time.</li>
				<li><b>Office</b>: You can find me during work hours at LIA, Laboratorio di Informatica
				Avanzata at Viale risorgimento 2, Bologna.</li>
				<li><b>Ulisse</b>: If you like to join or simply attend at the Ulisse team working you
				can find me at laboratorio 2 in Viale risorgimento 2, Bologna Wednesday evening
				from 18:30 to 23:00.</li>
				<li><b>ADMStaff</b>: As for the Ulisse team, if you have some questions about ADMStaff
				you can occasionally find me in the ADMStanzetta, inside the laboratory of computer
				science in via Ranzani complex.
				<li>Avoid as much as you can <code>skype</code>,
				<code>whatsapp</code> and <code>doc[x]</code> documents.
				I am against the concept of closed source and proprietary software, therefore I don't use them.</li>
			</ul>
